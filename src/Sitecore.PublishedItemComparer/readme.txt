The Published Item Comparer is a Shared Source Sitecore module that quickly validates the current item in the 
content tree with the same item in a target database such as the “web” database. This includes the ability to 
visually inspect the differences in the content as well as executing a series 
of validations that are useful in determining why an item may not be published correctly.
